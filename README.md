# 🔋 Battery Module – Engineering Thesis Project  

This battery is part of our **engineering thesis**, where we design and build an **electric go-kart 🏎️⚡**.  
The battery configuration is 26s 5p with expected output of 225A const and 450A peak. 
With peak voltage the theoretical maximum power output will be 49.5 kW. 

All models and assemblies are created using **SOLIDWORKS 2025 🛠️**.
